      "commitMessage": "Import Map.Entry almost everywhere.\n\nQualified types make @Nullable annotations more complicated: If we\u0027re using a type annotation, the \"@Nullable\" has to come between \"Map.\" and \"Entry\" rather than before the whole thing. That means diffs between the mainline, presuming that it supports type annotations, and the backport, presuming that it doesn\u0027t. It\u0027s not entirely clear that that\u0027s how things will work out, but I can\u0027t experiment until I fix the problem, and I figure I might as well submit the fix, given that I think we generally like doing this, at least with Multiset.Entry isn\u0027t in play? But it\u0027s not very hard to handle the problem as it comes up, either, if this CL is too much.\n\n(Naturally, the same problem will exist for other types. But this CL fixes the most common problem.)\n\nRELNOTES\u003dn/a\n\n-------------\nCreated by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe\nMOE_MIGRATED_REVID\u003d175999659\n",
