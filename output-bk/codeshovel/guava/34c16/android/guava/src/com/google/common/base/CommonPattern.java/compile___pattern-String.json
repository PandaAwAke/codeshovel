The implementations delegate to the underlying Pattern classes, which use identity equality. If we want \"real\" equality, we should check the equality of pattern() and flags(). Why bother now? Because our automated equals() tests expect equals(), if present, to behave in a sane way once they discover the CommonPattern.compile() factory method (which they now do, since it\u0027s now located on CommonPattern itself).\n\nRELNOTES\u003dn/a\n\n-------------\nCreated by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe\nMOE_MIGRATED_REVID\u003d202132002\n",
