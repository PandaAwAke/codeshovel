From a user perspective, the main benefit of this upgrade is the enhanced support for sparse fields, whose resource consumption is now function of the number of docs that have a value rather than the total number of docs in the index.\r\n\r\nSome notes about the change:\r\n - it includes the deprecation of the `disable_coord` parameter of the `bool` and `common_terms` queries: Lucene has removed support for coord factors\r\n - it includes the deprecation of the `index.similarity.base` expert setting, since it was only useful to configure coords and query norms, which have both been removed\r\n - two tests have been marked with `@AwaitsFix` because of #23966, which we intend to address after the merge",
