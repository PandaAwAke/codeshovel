## Create baseline from IntelliJ

Either:
* Select whole method > Right-click > Show history for selection
* Right-click on method > Show history for method (only Java)

Then in the history view: Select all (cmd+a) > Right-click > Copy revision number

The clipboard will contain the revision numbers separated by spaces.

I wrote a command that makes it content as we require it for our JSON object (right in the clipboard):
pbpaste | tr " " "\n" | sed -n '1!G;h;$p' | sed -E "s/^(.*)$/\"\1\",/" | pbcopy

Note that pbpaste and pbcopy are Mac-specific.
